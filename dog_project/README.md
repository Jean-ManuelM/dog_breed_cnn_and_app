## Introduction & Motivation 
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project,we build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

To complete this approach, you can play with this algorithm in a web application.

## Project Writeup
You wil find the project Writeup in the root repository.
It contains all the explanations needed to understand the projects.



## Web Application
To use this model, you can find a web app running with Flask.

### Instructions to run the Web application

1.You can clone the current repository.

2.You need to download the Resnet50 model at this adress https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz and store this file as "DogResnet50Data.npz" in the folder "bottleneck_features".

3. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

4. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
