## Introduction & Motivation 
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project,we build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

To complete this approach, you can play with this algorithm in a web application.

## Model creation

You can find all the steps related to the creation and of the differents functions and model necessary to our task in the associated notebook dog_app.ipynb.

The main steps are :
- Import the Dataset
- Create a Human Detector Humans 
- Create a dog Detector Humans 
- Create a CNN to classify Breeds, from scratch --> 2% of accurency
- Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds, with Transfer Learning --> 65 % of accurency
- Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds, , with Transfer Learning with specialise model --> 80% of accurency
- Sum-up the all in a function 

## Web Application
To use this model, you can find a web app running with Flask.

### Instructions to run the Web application

1.You can clone the current repository.

2.You need to download the Resnet50 model at this adress https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogResnet50Data.npz and store this file as "DogResnet50Data.npz" in the folder "bottleneck_features".

3. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

4. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
